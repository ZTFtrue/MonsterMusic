/**
 * A Window function represents a curve which is applied to a sample buffer to
 * reduce the introduction of spectral leakage in the Fourier transform.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Windowing</b>
 * <p>
 * Windowing is the process of shaping the audio samples before transforming
 * them to the frequency domain. The Fourier Transform assumes the sample buffer
 * is is a repetitive signal, if a sample buffer is not truly periodic within
 * the measured interval sharp discontinuities may arise that can introduce
 * spectral leakage. Spectral leakage is the speading of signal energy across
 * multiple FFT bins. This "spreading" can drown out narrow band signals and
 * hinder detection.
 * <p>
 * A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_function">windowing
 * function</a> attempts to reduce spectral leakage by attenuating the measured
 * sample buffer at its end points to eliminate discontinuities. If you call the
 * <code>window()</code> function with an appropriate WindowFunction, such as
 * <code>HammingWindow()</code>, the sample buffers passed to the object for
 * analysis will be shaped by the current window before being transformed. The
 * result of using a window is to reduce the leakage in the spectrum somewhat.
 * <p>
 * <code>WindowFunction</code> handles work associated with various window
 * functions such as the Hamming window. To create your own window function you
 * must extend <code>WindowFunction</code> and implement the
 * {@link #value(int, int) value} method which defines the shape of the window
 * at a given offset. <code>WindowFunction</code> will call this method to apply
 * the window to a sample buffer. The number passed to the method is an offset
 * within the length of the window curve.

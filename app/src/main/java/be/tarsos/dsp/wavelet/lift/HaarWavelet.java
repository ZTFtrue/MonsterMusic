/**
 * <p>
 * HaarWavelet (flat LineWavelet) wavelet.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * As with all Lifting scheme wavelet transform functions, the first stage of a
 * transform step is the split stage. The split step moves the even element to
 * the first half of an N element region and the odd elements to the second half
 * of the N element region.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The Lifting Scheme version of the HaarWavelet transform uses a wavelet
 * function (predict stage) that "predicts" that an odd element will have the
 * same value as it preceeding even element. Stated another way, the odd element
 * is "predicted" to be on a flat (zero slope LineWavelet) shared with the even
 * point. The difference between this "prediction" and the actual odd value
 * replaces the odd element.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The wavelet scaling function (a.k.a. smoothing function) used in the update
 * stage calculates the average between an even and an odd element.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The merge stage at the end of the inverse transform interleaves odd and even
 * elements from the two halves of the array (e.g., ordering them
 * even<sub>0</sub>, odd<sub>0</sub>, even<sub>1</sub>, odd<sub>1</sub>, ...)

	 * The wavelet transform calculates a set of detail or difference
	 * coefficients in the predict step. These are stored in the upper half of
	 * the array. The update step calculates an average from the even-odd
	 * element pairs. The averages will replace the even elements in the lower
	 * half of the array.

	 * 	      a j+1, i  = even j, i  = (even j, i  + odd j, i )/2
	 * </pre>
	 * <p>
	 * Note that the Lifting Scheme uses an in-place algorithm. The odd elements
	 * have been replaced by the detail coefficients in the predict step. With a
	 * little algebra we can substitute the coefficient calculation into the
	 * average calculation, which gives us

 * <p>
 * HaarWavelet transform extended with a polynomial interpolation step
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This wavelet transform extends the HaarWavelet transform with a polynomial
 * wavelet function.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The polynomial wavelet uses 4-point polynomial interpolation to "predict" an
 * odd point from four even point values.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class extends the HaarWavelet transform with an interpolation stage
 * which follows the predict and update stages of the HaarWavelet transform. The
 * predict value is calculated from the even points, which in this case are the
 * smoothed values calculated by the scaling function (e.g., the averages of the
 * even and odd values).
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The predict value is subtracted from the current odd value, which is the
 * result of the HaarWavelet wavelet function (e.g., the difference between the
 * odd value and the even value). This tends to result in large odd values after
 * the interpolation stage, which is a weakness in this algorithm.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This algorithm was suggested by Wim Sweldens' tutorial <i>Building Your Own
 * Wavelets at Home</i>.

	 * <p>
	 * The four points used in the polynomial interpolation are the even points.
	 * We pretend that these four points are located at the x-coordinates
	 * 0,1,2,3. The first odd point interpolated will be located between the
	 * first and second even point, at 0.5. The next N-3 points are located at

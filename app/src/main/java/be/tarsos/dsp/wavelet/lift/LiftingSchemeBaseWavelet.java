/**
 * <p>
 * class LiftingSchemeBaseWavelet: base class for simple Lifting Scheme wavelets
 * using split, predict, update or update, predict, merge steps.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Simple lifting scheme wavelets consist of three steps, a split/merge step,
 * predict step and an update step:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * The split step divides the elements in an array so that the even elements are
 * in the first half and the odd elements are in the second half.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * The merge step is the inverse of the split step. It takes two regions of an
 * array, an odd region and an even region and merges them into a new region
 * where an even element alternates with an odd element.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * The predict step calculates the difference between an odd element and its
 * predicted value based on the even elements. The difference between the
 * predicted value and the actual value replaces the odd element.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * The predict step operates on the odd elements. The update step operates on
 * the even element, replacing them with a difference between the predict value
 * and the actual odd element. The update step replaces each even element with
 * an average. The result of the update step becomes the input to the next
 * recursive step in the wavelet calculation.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * 
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The split and merge methods are shared by all Lifting Scheme wavelet
 * algorithms. This base class provides the transform and inverse transform
 * methods (forwardTrans and inverseTrans). The predict and update methods are
 * abstract and are defined for a particular Lifting Scheme wavelet sub-class.
 * </p>

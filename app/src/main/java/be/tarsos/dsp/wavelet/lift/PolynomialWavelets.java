/**
 * <p>
 * Polynomial wavelets
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This wavelet transform uses a polynomial interpolation wavelet (e.g., the
 * function used to calculate the differences). A HaarWavelet scaling function
 * (the calculation of the average for the even points) is used.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This wavelet transform uses a two stage version of the lifting scheme. In the
 * "classic" two stage Lifting Scheme wavelet the predict stage preceeds the
 * update stage. Also, the algorithm is absolutely symetric, with only the
 * operators (usually addition and subtraction) interchanged.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The problem with the classic Lifting Scheme transform is that it can be
 * difficult to determine how to calculate the smoothing (scaling) function in
 * the update phase once the predict stage has altered the odd values. This
 * version of the wavelet transform calculates the update stage first and then
 * calculates the predict stage from the modified update values. In this case
 * the predict stage uses 4-point polynomial interpolation using even values
 * that result from the update stage.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * In this version of the wavelet transform the update stage is no longer
 * perfectly symetric, since the forward and inverse transform equations differ
 * by more than an addition or subtraction operator. However, this version of
 * the transform produces a better result than the HaarWavelet transform
 * extended with a polynomial interpolation stage.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This algorithm was suggested to me from my reading of Wim Sweldens' tutorial
 * <i>Building Your Own Wavelets at Home</i>.

 * Cuesheet Block

 * <p>This block is for storing various information that can be used in a cue sheet. It supports track and index points,
 * compatible with Red Book CD digital audio discs, as well as other CD-DA metadata such as media catalog number and
 * track ISRCs. The CUESHEET block is especially useful for backing up CD-DA discs, but it can be used as a general
 * purpose cueing mechanism for playback

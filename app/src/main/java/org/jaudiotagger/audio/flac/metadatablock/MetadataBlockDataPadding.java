/**
 * Padding Block
 *
 * This block allows for an arbitrary amount of padding. The contents of a PADDING block have no meaning.
 *
 * This block is useful when it is known that metadata will be edited after encoding; the user can instruct the encoder
 * to reserve a PADDING block of sufficient size so that when metadata is added, it will simply overwrite the padding
 * (which is relatively quick) instead of having to insert it into the right place in the existing file
 * (which would normally require rewriting the entire file).
